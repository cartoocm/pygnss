Increasing $T_I$ a little can lead to better acquisition results, but if it's too long and there are navigation bit transitions, it will adversely affect results. If we do increase $T_I$, we should consider reducing the deviation for selecting valid $\\Delta Z_i$ values. The basic idea is, if a data bit transition occurs over one of the blocks, or in between adjacent blocks, we want our algorithm to throw away this result in step 6.\n",

    "One way we might try to do this is by taking the FFT of $x_{clean}$ for $100$ms or more (which yields a FFT bin resolution of $10$Hz or more). The problem with this is that we still have $D(t)$--the navigation data--in our signal. $D(t)$ is a random signal that exerts a 180 degree phase shift each time it changes, which is at a maximum possible rate of $50$Hz (i.e. the navigation bit rate). While it's possible that $D(t)$ doesn't change for our signal in the $100$ms or more of signal that you select, in general it will change. This will cause spreading of your $x_{clean}$ spectrum (which, without the spreading would just be a noise spectrum plus a peak at $\\Delta f_d$) by up to $50$Hz on either side of your carrier peak. We can still use the FFT method for finding $\\Delta f_d$, but we have to account for this spreading. When I've done this method, I used a constrained polynomial fit around the closest 7 points to the FFT peak of $100$ms of $x_{clean}$.\n",
