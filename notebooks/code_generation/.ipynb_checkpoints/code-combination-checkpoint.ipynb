    "The need often arises to either add or multiplex two codes together. The addition is modulo-2 addition of the codes at their respective rates for their least common multiple. The multiplexing is time multiplexing which interleaves two codes with the same length. For our purposes, we will ant a general `Code` class that stores symbol and rate information. This class will define constructors capable of taking two code objects and combining them as described above."
